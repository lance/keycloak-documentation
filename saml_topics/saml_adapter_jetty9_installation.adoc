[[_jetty9_adapter_installation]]
== Adapter Installation

Adapters are no longer included with the appliance or war distribution.Each adapter is a separate download on the Keycloak download site.
They are also available as a maven artifact. 

You must unzip the Jetty 9.x  distro into Jetty 9.x's root directory.
Including adapter's jars within your WEB-INF/lib directory will not work! 

[source]
----
$ cd $JETTY_HOME
$ unzip keycloak-saml-jetty92-adapter-dist.zip
----    
Next, you will have to enable the keycloak module for your jetty.base. 

[source]
----
$ cd your-base
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-to-startd=keycloak
----
